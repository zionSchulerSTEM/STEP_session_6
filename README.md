## The big picture

Using physics, algebra, calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra, one can analyticaly describe the behaviour of a circuit. My old circuits professor told me that one should understand a circuit completely analytically before going in to build the circuit, and I think this is very true for folks wanting to become circuit designers. A circuit designer must not only be able to assemble a circuit, which is rather straightforward these days, but describe its behaviour and understand the tradeoffs that the designer made when making the circuit. Circuits are systems that are compromised of circuit components. The first circuit components that any circuit designer or physics student learns are the resistor, the capcitor, and the inductor. These components are passive components, meaning that the component does not require an active power source in order to function. Furthermore, these components are linear, which simplifies are analysis of circuit components that much more.
